# rtl8814AU
This repository contains a driver for the rtl8814AU chipset.  

The original downloaded archive indicated that kernels till version 5.1 are supported.  
With some adjustments I've made it work till 5.5, but it fails to compile against 5.6 (on Debian).

I don't have a device with this chipset, just happen to stumble upon the driver.  
That is one of the reasons I have no intention of spending time on it.  

You're of course free to use it, fork it and all the other freedoms granted to you by the [LICENSE](LICENSE).  
But don't expect me to spend time on it.
